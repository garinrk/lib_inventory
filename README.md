# LibraryInventory


Library Inventory is a repository home to an application created by Garin Richards.

It is meant to act as an inventory database for a small scale library. Requires a MySQL backend with a design that fits the requirements.

Web front end developed with JSP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and a bit of bootstrap.






Previous commit history and progress was sadly lost in the great move from Github to Bitbucket.
